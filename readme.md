Thank you for giving me this opportunity to interview/(talk with you today) for this role today. My name is Ferdinand Awa, I've been in the tech industry for about 7yrs now. 
Over these years  I have been privileged  to work at  various capacities, that is from an infrastructure support analyst (intern role), after which I gained experience to becoming  a Jr infrastructure engineer, and later moving up the ranks of a CLOUD ENGINEER  and to now a DevOps Engineer in the Cloud.
 
In my years of experience, I have been able to find inefficiencies within different systems and pipelines which actually led  me to being able to  build  robust solutions with various AWS services.
 
Over these years, I've had the privilege to work with many customers and clients and to help  them achieve their digital transformation journey, by building and setting up  automated pipelines from the integration phase to the deployment phase that is CICD pipelines.
 
My experience is kinda in-depth, because I've been able to work on different AWS services and also use lots of automated tools.
 
That is ……. On Cloud Orchestration and automation, I have leveraged AWS cloud formation and terraform for automating and provisioning of resources which is actually IaaC and also made use of Kubernetes for container orchestration.
 
I have made use of AWS lambda for event driven compute needs, and for server-less web applications. 
I have leveraged  Elasticsearch  for log analytics, full-text search, security intelligence, business analytics, and operational intelligence.
I have configured AWS systems manager, control tower, Docker, Jenkins, Elastic Container Service and Elastic Kubernetes service.
I have experience working with (WAF) web application firewalls to secure applications in production. I have managed the deployment of WAFs, configured them to block malicious traffic and attacks, and tested that they are functioning correctly. 
 I have also leverage configuration management tools like ansible which is an open-source tool. I had the privilege to set up an ansible friendly environment which we used it for Application deployment. 
(Other things I've had to do is…)
I have configured and deployed a docker-enabled application to Amazon Elastic Container service (Amazon ECS) including building a blue/green deployment model. I have also implemented containers on AWS using EKS (Elastic Kubernetes service) and other complementary services.
I have made use of  Datadog including setting up a platform for monitoring and alerting on Kubernetes clusters. I have created custom dashboards to track key metrics such as resource utilization, performance and latency.
 Also, I have been privileged to construct a functioning CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploy application version changes from our GitHub repo to our production environment.
I have leverage Jenkins open source automation server to deploy code build artifacts with codedeploy.
I also do have with experience with CICD tools includes setting up automated processes for deploying applications and services. I have used tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI,  Azure Devops, and AWS CodePipeline for automating the release process. Additionally, I have integrated CICD pipelines with version control systems such as Git and Mercurial, as well as with development and testing frameworks. I have also configured automation stages such as build, package, test, security scan, and deployment to production.
A couple of other third-party tools that I have leverage to build robust CICD pipelines are (Nexus, Maven, Gradle) for build, (Splunk, Nagios, prometheus and datadog) for Monitoring, (Selenium) for testing, (Docker) for deployment and Jenkins
 
In my current environment, as a DevOps engineer, I am responsible for  : 

	1- Building And Release Processes 
	2- Managing our User access on Resources (that is Grant and Revoke access) 
	3- Managing our GIT Branches 
	4- Automation (Jenkins pipeline / Ansible configuration) 
	5- I am responsible for our Servers & Applications support 
	6- I Ensure our systems Backup and also Create Backup Policies
	7- Choosing the right deployment models for the environments. 
	8- I monitor and Secure our CICD pipeline
	9-I Monitor our environment and track key metrics such as resources utilization, performance and latency.
